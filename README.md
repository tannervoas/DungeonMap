# DungeonMap
Git for mapping application for dungeons in D&amp;D


Expects to be installed in a folder titled C:/Git Repos/
This will produce C:/Git Repos/DungeonMap
If this isnt the case the includes in the visual studio project will not work and must be changed. 
This is fine but will cause issues for other people when you push out your version.
